<p>
The name of our game is “Hallway Surfers”. The objective of our game is to help the chicken escape bayside high school. The chicken needs to keep its health above 20 before the time limit is over and the chicken would need to face obstacles in the hallways. Some obstacles that the chicken needs to avoid are tests, books and teachers in the hallways. The chicken needs to make sure that they don’t  bump into the various obstacles while they move to diverse places. If the chicken does, the chickens’ health would have to decrease a certain amount of points depending on what kind of obstacles they hit.

<p>
For example, if the chicken bumps into a teacher then the health will decrease by 15. However, the player can regain the points by collecting books. Collecting these books helps  the player increase their health by 5 and get points. These points help you win and when you have 15 points then you win! To move the chicken the player  must use the arrow keys to move up,down,and left to right.
